Self-Driving Car using Reinforcement Learning (CARLA)

This project implements a reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving pipeline using the CARLA simulator.
The system is designed with a modular environment architecture and a Gym-compatible interface to support PPO training.

Current progress:
- Virtual environment setup
- CPU-based PyTorch configuration
- Custom CARLA environment (mocked)
- Gym/Gymnasium wrapper
- PPO training pipeline (tested with dummy environment)

CARLA integration is in progress.
