This project implements a reinforcement learning–based autonomous driving agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
The focus is on machine learning concepts such as policy optimization, reward design, and training stability rather than simulator realism.
A lightweight driving simulator (Highway-Env) is used to enable efficient RL training on limited hardware.
